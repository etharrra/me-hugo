### Souvenir Map of Japan

##### [Project Link](https://souvenir-map-japan-th.netlify.app/)

##### Objective:

This project aimed to create a visually appealing webpage featuring an interactive map of Japan that showcases the unique local souvenirs of each prefecture.

##### Responsibilities:

I made a slider to display souvenir items for each prefecture when hovered over on the map, along with an SVG map that highlights the region when hovered over and shows the associated souvenir items when clicked. The souvenir data is stored in a JSON file.

##### Technologies:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
