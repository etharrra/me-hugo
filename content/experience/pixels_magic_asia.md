### Backend Developer - [Pixels Magic Asia](https://pixelsmagic.com/)

### Dec 2023 - Present | Hong Kong (Remote)

As a **Backend Developer** at Pixels Magic Asia (remote, since December 2023), I have played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining dynamic content management systems using PHP, JavaScript, Node.js Laravel, Strapi, Yii frameworks, and Go, delivering robust and scalable solutions that improved site performance and efficiency. My responsibilities also include managing databases across multiple servers, ensuring data integrity, and executing seamless migrations and updates in line with industry best practices.

I have leveraged Shell scripting to automate daily traffic reporting, extracting and processing complex server log data for more effective analytics. My experience with AWS has enabled me to oversee secure deployments by configuring IAM user access and security groups, upholding stringent security protocols. Additionally, I prioritize clear documentation and comprehensive quality assurance testing, crafting detailed development guides and flowcharts while conducting thorough QA to ensure consistent application reliability and long-term maintenance.
