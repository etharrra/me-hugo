### Web Developer - [Brain Myanmar](https://www.brain-net.co.jp/company/)

### June 2020 - Feb 2023 | Yangon (Onsite)

As a **Web Developer** at Brain Myanmar, I contributed significantly as a Web Developer by collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver comprehensive project specifications and visual documentation, including detailed flowcharts to map out website processes. My work emphasized enhancing user experience and functionality by developing new features and optimizing existing ones using JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, Google App Script, and Excel VBA.

A crucial part of my role involved rigorous testing and validation of website functionalities to ensure quality and adherence to project specifications. I identified and resolved bugs efficiently, contributing to robust and high-quality project outcomes. Additionally, I maintained transparent communication with project teams by generating daily progress reports for the Project Manager, detailing updates, challenges, and achievements to keep everyone aligned and facilitate timely project completions.
