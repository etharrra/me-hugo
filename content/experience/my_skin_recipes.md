During my tenure as a **Web Developer at MySkinRecipes**, I played a key role in developing and maintaining a sophisticated e-commerce platform using PrestaShop 8.0. My responsibilities included crafting various custom modules for essential functions such as payment processing, tax calculations, and shipping logistics, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

I demonstrated expertise in automation by building a web application with Laravel and Roach PHP to facilitate hourly data scraping, showcasing my proficiency in data extraction and task scheduling. Collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams, I identified and resolved technical challenges, optimized website performance, and implemented comprehensive security protocols. My commitment to quality was underscored by thorough quality assurance testing and meticulous documentation, supporting knowledge transfer and ongoing platform maintenance.
